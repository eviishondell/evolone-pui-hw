# **FP1 \- Proposal for Critique**

## Idea Sketches

### _Idea 1_

![Portfolio](final-project/images/portfolio-sketch.png)

**What is the basic idea of your final project?**  
I plan a portfolio to make myself competitive for design roles.

**How do you plan to make your design interactive and engaging?**  
I plan to add microinteractions to show that buttons are clickable. Potentially adding live demos would be a stretch goal.

**How do you plan to make your design accessible?**  
I plan to add alt text to make sure the user knows what they are interacting with. I can also attempt to add live demos of my projects.

**What information do you specifically want to convey and include on your website?**  
I want to showcase my projects and skills. I basically want an interactive resume.

### _Idea 2_

![Planet Tech](final-project/images/planettech-sketch.png)

**What is the basic idea of your final project?**  
I want to introduce users to other fields in tech outside of software engineering.

**How do you plan to make your design interactive and engaging?**  
I want them to take a quiz that can match them to the field they can look into.

**How do you plan to make your design accessible?**  
Since a lot will be going on, adding focus indicators will help the user to complete tasks without getting distracted.

**What information do you specifically want to convey and include on your website?**  
I want to display the different fields and resume tips to increase the likeliness of getting properly placed in the tech field.

### _Idea 3_

![Movie Suggestion Generator](final-project/images/moviegen-sketch.png)

**What is the basic idea of your final project?**  
I want to help users pick a movie to watch when they can't decide.

**How do you plan to make your design interactive and engaging?**  
I plan to have the users answer a series of questions that will lead to an accurate movie suggestion based on API parameters.

**How do you plan to make your design accessible?**  
Using semantic elements and adding alt-text will help make the design more accessible. Also, adding highly contrasting colors will make the text legible.

**What information do you specifically want to convey and include on your website?**  
I want users to learn about movies they would've never considered before taking the quiz on the website.
