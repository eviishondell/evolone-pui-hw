# **FP2 \- Evaluation of the Final project**

## Project Description

I want to code a portfolio for my programming class because I need a central place to showcase my work and technical skills. Since I'm applying to a PhD program in a scientific field, having a professional portfolio would be a huge asset for sharing my research, projects, and technical experience with potential advisors and admissions committees. Right now, I don’t have an online portfolio, and creating one would allow me to present my work in a polished, organized way.

This portfolio will also be critical for future internships and full-time roles, especially in tech areas where demonstrating hands-on experience is essential. Building it will give me the opportunity to practice front-end development and design, ensuring I have a high-quality, professional site to represent my skills and experience.

I want users to learn about movies they would've never considered before taking the quiz on the website.

## Feedback Summary

In my recent portfolio lab session, I received valuable feedback on enhancing the user experience and visual design across multiple sections. Starting with the Home Page, it was recommended that I incorporate more microinteractions to make the experience feel dynamic and responsive. These subtle animations can guide user actions and create a more engaging first impression. Additionally, shifting towards illustrative storytelling and using fewer words could help communicate my narrative more effectively and capture users’ attention quickly.

On the Resume Page, feedback focused on improving visual hierarchy to better direct the viewer’s eye. This could involve experimenting with typography, spacing, or color contrasts that guide users naturally from one section to another. Instead of traditional company logos, using team icons or simplified visuals could create a clean, cohesive look while still conveying my experience. Adding a “Download PDF” button was also suggested to provide easy access for users who want to view my resume offline.

For the Projects section, suggestions included making the page more interactive, encouraging users to engage with my work actively. This could mean implementing hover effects, interactive elements, or embedded prototype previews that offer a hands-on experience. Additionally, I was encouraged to find ways to maintain user interest, such as adding tooltips or brief descriptions to explain each project’s context and unique challenges. To address potential NDA restrictions, it may be wise to consider password-protected sections to securely display work without violating confidentiality agreements.

Finally, for the Accomplishments section, I received advice to rethink the layout to improve alignment and readability. Using a grid with rectangles or squares could provide a structured, visually appealing format that’s easier for users to scan and absorb information quickly. By implementing these changes, I can create a portfolio that feels polished, interactive, and tailored to my audience’s experience.

For the website prototype focused on tech fields and resume help, I received some insightful feedback on the Resume Page. Some users felt that the checklist format for resume tips made the experience feel rigid and passive. They suggested transforming it into a more interactive experience, possibly by guiding users through personalized steps, such as tips tailored to different resume sections or interactive prompts that encourage users to add their own inputs along the way. Additionally, many noted that the background stars should be animated, creating a dynamic effect to immerse users and visually represent the “journey” of career building. This subtle, moving backdrop could add depth to the page, helping users feel more engaged as they explore the content. Overall, these recommendations focus on making the Resume Page both interactive and visually captivating to enhance the learning experience.

For the movie suggestions site that prompts users with questions to recommend films, I received valuable feedback regarding both the visual design and overall user experience. A key critique was to change the color theme from orange to something more inviting and warm, as users felt the current palette was a bit harsh and not conducive to a relaxed browsing experience. Suggestions included using softer colors or a more vibrant combination that evokes a sense of fun and excitement.

Additionally, users noted that the site felt somewhat plain and could benefit from more engaging elements. They recommended exploring ways to make the interface more interactive and enjoyable, such as incorporating playful animations, dynamic transitions, or even thematic visuals that relate to the movies being suggested. Enhancing the overall aesthetics and interactivity of the site will not only make it more visually appealing but also create a more enjoyable experience for users as they navigate through movie recommendations. By implementing these changes, I aim to foster a more inviting atmosphere that encourages users to explore and discover new films.

## Feedback Digestion

In my recent portfolio lab, I received feedback focused on enhancing interactivity, visual storytelling, usability, and layout. A key suggestion was to incorporate more microinteractions on the Home Page to make the experience feel lively and guide users naturally through the content. This subtle interactivity can significantly improve user engagement, so I plan to add these in my next design. For instance, I might use animations when hovering over elements or smooth transitions between sections, as these details can elevate the overall user experience without overwhelming the page.

The idea of implementing illustrative storytelling was another valuable critique. This would involve visually conveying my narrative rather than relying heavily on text. I see the potential of incorporating illustrations to highlight specific project insights and personal experiences, making my portfolio more memorable and approachable. Since reducing text aligns with this approach, I’ll work to replace some descriptive content with visuals that communicate effectively on their own.

Adding a “Download PDF” button on the Resume Page was also recommended, to give users easy access to my resume in a downloadable format. This feature enhances convenience for viewers, especially recruiters who might want to save my resume directly. Given its practical value, I’ll prioritize this addition in my upcoming design update.

Finally, feedback on the Accomplishments page layout suggested switching to a grid of rectangles or squares for better alignment and readability. While I see the merit in a structured grid, I’d like to explore hybrid layouts first to balance visual appeal with functionality. I’ll test a few formats and gather feedback to ensure the design remains easy to navigate.

In summary, I’ll prioritize microinteractions, illustrative storytelling, and the PDF download button, as these adjustments should enhance usability and overall presentation. I’ll approach the layout revision thoughtfully to maintain both structure and creativity.

For the website prototype focused on tech fields and resume help, the feedback highlighted the need for a more interactive and engaging Resume Page. Users expressed that the current checklist format felt too rigid, suggesting a shift towards a more dynamic experience. Implementing personalized steps for resume building, such as tailored tips for different sections, could enhance user engagement and encourage active participation. Additionally, incorporating interactive elements—like prompts for users to input their own information—would create a more hands-on learning experience. Another suggestion was to animate the background stars, which could add visual interest and create an immersive atmosphere, making the content more engaging for users. These changes aim to transform the Resume Page into a lively, user-centric space that fosters deeper interaction and learning.
